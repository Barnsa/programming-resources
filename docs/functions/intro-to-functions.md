# Functions
Functions are the way in which we encapsulate code so that it can be reused multiple times. Sometimes this is in a single program and other times it's to include inside our own custom  library. 

Any time code needs to be executed or evaluated in the same way, it can also be passed into a function to have the same process done to it. By passing functions to functions we can build up any complex arrangement you can think of, and is how all modern programs are constructed. 

Some functions inside python are built in functions that do a specific job or exhibit a specific behaviour. There are also ways to perform small inline functions in this manner. This will be covered in the [built in functions](built-in-functions/README.md) section.
