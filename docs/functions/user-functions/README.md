# Functions
Functions are self contained objects that are used to create code that we often want to reuse. The most arbitrary use of a function is in this code:

{{ code_from_file("conditionals/example-1.py", 1, 10, execute=True) }}

As you can see, we have created our first function. To create a function you must first use the def keyword followed by the name for the function. The naming conventions for functions are the same as they are for variables. However, it is good practice to have descriptive names for your functions so that you can recognise what they do at a glance.
