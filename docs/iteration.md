# Iteration

{{ todo("Actually write this") }}


Anytime you want to do anything more than once in a Python program, you should consider putting it inside a loop.  
There are two types of loops in python, a 'for' loop and a 'while' loop. Generally 'for' loops are used when you know the amount of times you want to repeat something. It doesn't have to be an exact integer value, it can also be anything easily calculable. 'While' loops are used when you aren't sure how many times you need to repeat something, this could be to repeat something until a condition is reached or until a user tells it to stop.
